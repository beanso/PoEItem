Utility to create pictoral representations of items in Path of Exile.

![Marohi Erqi](/images/Marohi Erqi.png?raw=true "Marohi Erqi")

Currently using the internal JSON representation of the item to create the tooltip but will expand to a Chrome extension allowing you to create a picture from the site.

Also planning to import item data from the textual representation provided when Ctrl-C'ing an item in game.
